Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to a class of models that are capable of creating new data rather than only analyzing existing information.
These models learn underlying patterns from large datasets and use them to generate text, images, audio, or code.

Large language models are a core component of modern generative AI systems.
They are trained using massive text corpora and rely on transformer architectures to understand contextual relationships between words.

The transformer architecture introduced the concept of self-attention, which allows models to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence.
This mechanism enables long-range dependency modeling, making transformers highly effective for text generation tasks.

GPT-2 is a transformer-based language model developed to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
It is trained using unsupervised learning on large-scale internet text data.

Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model involves adapting it to a specific domain or writing style.
This process improves the relevance and coherence of generated text for targeted applications.

Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in natural language processing.
Byte Pair Encoding is commonly used in GPT-style models to efficiently represent text at the subword level.

During training, the language model learns to predict the next token based on previous context.
This objective is known as causal language modeling.

Loss functions such as cross-entropy are used to measure the difference between predicted and actual tokens.
A decreasing loss value indicates that the model is learning effectively.

Text generation quality can be controlled using parameters such as temperature, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling.
Lower temperature values produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values increase creativity.

Generative AI models have applications in content creation, chatbots, summarization, translation, and question answering.
They are widely used in industries such as education, healthcare, and software development.

Ethical considerations are critical when deploying generative AI systems.
Issues such as bias, hallucination, and misuse must be carefully addressed.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective input prompts to guide model outputs.
Well-structured prompts significantly improve the relevance of generated text.

Fine-tuned language models often outperform zero-shot models on domain-specific tasks.
This makes fine-tuning an essential step for practical applications.

Evaluation metrics such as perplexity are used to assess language model performance.
Lower perplexity values generally indicate better predictive capability.

Training large language models requires significant computational resources.
However, fine-tuning smaller models like GPT-2 can be performed on consumer-grade hardware.

Generative AI systems continue to evolve with advances in model architecture and training strategies.
Future research focuses on improving efficiency, alignment, and controllability of generated outputs.

Text generation models can assist humans by augmenting creativity rather than replacing it.
Human oversight remains essential to ensure correctness and responsibility.

The success of generative AI highlights the importance of data quality.
Well-curated datasets lead to more coherent and reliable text generation.

Transformer-based models have become the foundation of modern natural language processing.
Their scalability and performance have revolutionized AI-driven text generation.

Fine-tuned GPT-2 models demonstrate how pre-trained transformers can be adapted efficiently.
This approach reduces training cost while maintaining high-quality outputs.
